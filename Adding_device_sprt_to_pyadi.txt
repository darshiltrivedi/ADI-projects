# Step by Step guide to add device support to pyadi-iio

1: Fork the analogdevices/pyadi-iio.git to your account. (Allows to edit things with admin rights)

2: Create a developer branch of device whose support you want to add.

3: Clone the branch to your local linux machine by typing command-
	- git clone --branch branch_name https:/github.com/your_git-id/pyadi-iio.git

4: Change adi/__init__.py file. Import created device API in constructor.

5: Add API file of device in same folder i.e. adi/device_API.py

6: Add examples on how to use the devices with python in examples/dev_example.py

7: Add hardware test to test/dev_test.py
	-To run a hardware test type- pytest ./test/test_ad4630.py -vs --hw=ad4630-24 --uri=ip:analog.local in terminal
	Note use / for linux and \ for windows
	Also make sure you are in pyadi folder while performing test.
	create device emulation to test software with hardware. For further info visit:- https://pytest-libiio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/emulation/

8: Add document file in doc/source/devices/adi.dev_name.rst
	-update doc/source/devices/index.rst to add name of device in index of html

9: Update supported_parts.md in root of pyadi.

10: Make the html files
	- In termincal cd to pyadi-iio/doc & run sudo make html

11: Add all the updated files to local git
	- sudo git add -A

12: In pyadi, do pre-commit checks
	- sudo pre-commit install
	- sudo pre-commit run
	- If pre-commit changes any file repeat step number 11 i.e. add the update file

13:Check status for you local git repo to see if all the files are added correctly
	- git status ( All added files should be in green)

14: Commit the changes to your local git repo
	- sudo git commit -m "Enter message of commit here"

15: Make your git global from local device
	- sudo git push
	- enter your login credentials. you might need to generate git token for yourself for 1st time and use that token password as password.
