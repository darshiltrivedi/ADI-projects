Driver side of this:-

Changed device attributes to channel attribute as IIO info says it has channel attributes
The name of channel is "altvoltage0"
For 3-wire spi of RPI MISO is left unconnected
In bidirectional SPI mode the same SPI standard is implemented, except that a single wire is used for data (MOMI) instead of the two used in standard mode (MISO and MOSI). In this mode, the MOSI pin serves as MOMI pin.





Device side of things:-

If the device is not working freq spectrum will show 10.606GHz as it is the bare minimum freq when the device is powered up.
When freq is 10.606GHz (min) Vtune is 0.0 i.e. pll is not working when freq is 13GHz(max) Vtune is 15V it means that is limit of op-amp and pll.
Op-amp power is neccesary to make it work. 
Vtune changes with type of ramp and Output frequency.
Windows GUI doesn't work if the phase detector polarity is positive.
