ADALM-PLUTO Rev.C comes with ad9363 which is an RF Transceiver IC.
By default it comes with RF coverage from 325 MHz to 3.8 GHz, Up to 20 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and 1 receieve and 1 transmit channel.

If you unscrew the blue box of pluto to see actual board, you can see another unsed channel. 

With a small hack on this you can use those channels and upgrade RF coverage from 700MHz to 6GHz and increas bandwidth upto 56MHz.

To Apply this hack:-

# Step 1:- Upgrade Pluto to Latest Firmware.
Here a link to wiki analog on how to do so - o	https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/firmware#upgrading
There is a small change to upgrade process, instead of copying just pluto.frm file, copy entire unzipped upgrade file that you downloaded to Pluto mass storage device. 
Follow rest of the steps in same order that is eject non parent drive and wait for pluto to reconnect itself.

# Step 2:- Next step is to ssh into pluto and change few configurations.
You can use putty, powershell of program of your choice to ssh into pluto. The default ip address of pluto is 192.168.2.1 if you have changed it use ip address accordingly.
Here how you can change pluto's IP address:- https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/customizing

Login as root and password for root by default is analog. 
i.e. Login as: root
password: analog

Enter Few Line of codes as below:-

fw_setenv attr_name compatible
fw_setenv attr_val ad9361
fw_setenv compatible ad9361
fw_setenv mode 2r2t
reboot

After the Reboot again SSH into pluto to check whether the hack is done correctly or not. To do so print the env that you just set by typing

fw_printenv attr_name
fw_printenv attr_val
fw_printenv compatible
fw_printenv mode

You should get something like this:-
fw_printenv attr_name
attr_name=compatible
fw_printenv attr_val
attr_val=ad9361
fw_printenv compatible
compatible=ad9361
fw_printenv mode
mode=2r2t

Make sure the order of command is same. If you get mode=1r1t make sure you upgraded pluto correctly using entire zip file in masss storage and not just update.frm file.
