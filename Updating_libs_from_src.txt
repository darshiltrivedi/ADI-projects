# Hacks on Fresh Kuiper Linux and Building from source

## Importing ADI and rx failing on current freshly burnt KUIPER linux 

##  Built pyadi and libiio from source

#Update libiio:
git clone https://www.github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio
cd libiio
cmake .
make
sudo make install

# Update pyadi-iio
git clone https://www.github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio
cd pyadi-iio
sudo python3 setup.py install

# Update pylibiio:
sudo pip3 install pylibiio==0.23.1

# and finallyâ€¦ this is probably not the right thing to do, but after installing pylibiio version 0.23.1, iio.version was still 0.21! Okay, check iio.__file__ , which pointed to /lib/python3.7/site-packages/iio.py. But pip3 install process noted that it was installed to dist-packages. So to check if Python defers back to dist-packages:
sudo mv /lib/python3.7/site-packages/iio.py /lib/python3.7/site-packages/iio_save.py
