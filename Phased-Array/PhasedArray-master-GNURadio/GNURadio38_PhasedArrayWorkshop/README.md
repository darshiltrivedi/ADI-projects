These are the GNUradio flowgraphs to run the lab on.  They work great on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.  But I would recommend that you first download the entire Raspberry Pi SD card here:
https://download.analog.com/phased-array-lab/raspi.7z

It's a big file (3GB), so it'll take a while to download.  Then unzip using using 7-Zip.  Then burn it to a 32 GB (not 16, not >32GB!) micro SD card using Win32 Disk Imager (or some equivalent program).  Then place that micro SD card into your Raspberry Pi, and you will be up and running!  No other install or downloads are required.  

However, the GNU Radio files on that image may not be them most up to date.  So it's always a good idea to check the version in this "PhasedArrayLab_GNURadio" folder and make sure you have the latest.
